# Month-end close notes

Close notes for one period they name: gather inputs, record rec status per account, list open questions, and write a short close pack. Accruals only if they already use them. Do not call the month filed, audited, or closed if a rec is open and they did not accept it. Do not mix two months. Do not hide plugs in a clean profit and loss. Ask what locked means here. Produce the input list, rec status CSV, questions CSV, and out/month-end.md. They or their CPA decide whether books are done enough for the CPA pack. Starter close list is a guess until they teach their checklist.

Starter work map. Replace tools and checks when they **teach**.
