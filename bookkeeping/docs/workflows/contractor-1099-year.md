# 1099 tracker (files only)

Build or refresh a contractor payment list for a year they name (ask fiscal versus calendar). Sum vendor payments from their files, mark W-9 present or missing by path only, and write a tracker pack. No TINs in the sheet. They or their CPA file. No worker-classification opinion and no move from payroll to 1099 to save tax. Do not e-file or upload to IRS FIRE. Do not quote a threshold as this shop's rule unless they taught it. Produce vendor YTD, W-9 status, and the tracker write-up. Starter "service vendor" flags are questions until they teach who is product-only or exempt.

Starter work map. Replace tools and checks when they **teach**.
