# Week calendar pack

Build the week's room and building pack from their calendar file. Copy room, date, start, and who they named. Flag collisions and blank rooms on events they already accepted. Do not invent a hold. Do not free a Saturday because it looks open. Weddings, funerals, and outside use stay on the rows they stored. Write-up names which file won when two calendars disagree. They publish. You pack the week.

Starter work map. Replace tools and checks when they **teach**.
