# Giving batch from export

List one batch they named from the giving export, then set it next to their signed count sheet. Flag amount or fund holes. Quote export versus sheet when they disagree. Do not invent a gift. Do not invent a deductible. Do not store account numbers. Dual-control signatures stay as written; you do not recount. Write-up is completeness, not a posting. They post and they deposit.

Starter work map. Replace tools and checks when they **teach**.
