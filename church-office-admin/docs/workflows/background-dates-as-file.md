# Background dates as file

From the volunteer roster, list background dates and their status words next to roles their policy PDF tags as date-required. Do not say anyone is cleared or safe. Do not invent a renewal law. Do not store a full report or an SSN. Missing dates on tagged roles stay flags. Write-up is dates versus roles, not a verdict. They talk to the person.

Starter work map. Replace tools and checks when they **teach**.
