# Board or session pack

Index the board-or-session folder against the packet list they stored: agenda, prior approved minutes, treasurer file, and ministry reports they dropped. Do not invent a motion. Do not treat draft minutes as adopted. Giving pages stay min necessary, not a donor CRM list. This is not a grant board pack. Write-up is present versus missing. They meet. You do not vote.

Starter work map. Replace tools and checks when they **teach**.

```yaml
id: board-pack
steps:
  - id: folder
    needs: []
    produces: folder
    produce_path: work/board-index.csv
    tool: docs/tools/board-pack-folder.md
    check: python docs/tools/checks/file-exists.py work/board-index.csv
    on_fail: retry
    next: [pack]
  - id: pack
    needs: [folder]
    produces: board-pack
    produce_path: out/board-pack.md
    tool: docs/tools/spreadsheet.md
    check: python docs/tools/checks/file-exists.py out/board-pack.md
    on_fail: retry
    next: []
