# Estimate from their price file

Fill their estimate template using only items and amounts on their price file. No added clinical lines. Quantity and which lines belong come from the veterinarian or a saved template they named. High-low ranges only if the template has those columns. Label the draft as a draft until their authorization process is done. Confirm the fee-file date. Starter / guess until they teach tabs and named bundles.

Starter work map. Replace tools and checks when they **teach**.
