# Truck calendar

List unit, date, and job from their truck calendar. Flag two firsts on one truck and jobs with no unit. Do not invent a free day or an empty weight. Shuttle units stay labeled if they coded them. Hired-hauler rows stay as they wrote them. They dispatch. You pack collisions and questions. Scale tickets are a different pack; do not fill tare from hope on this list.

Starter work map. Replace tools and checks when they **teach**.
