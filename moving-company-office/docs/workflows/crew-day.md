# Crew day list

Build the day list from their roster plus the calendar jobs they already booked. Copy planned headcount; do not invent a person or a wage. Canceled rows they marked stay off the live list. Piano, safe, or hoist notes stay attached as they wrote them. Gate codes stay out of the pack. They dispatch. You write the list and a short write-up. Overtime hours are not invented.

Starter work map. Replace tools and checks when they **teach**.
