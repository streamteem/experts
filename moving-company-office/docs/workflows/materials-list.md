# Materials list

Pull carton and crate quantities from their materials sheet and the inventory tally they named as live. Do not invent a box count or a materials dollar. PBO cartons they will not supply stay off the pull list if they coded PBO. Charges come from the rate file or materials sheet only. They pull stock. You write the list and questions. Credits follow their written rule, not a guess.

Starter work map. Replace tools and checks when they **teach**.
