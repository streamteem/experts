# Scatter and descriptive correlation

Plot two numeric columns they named. Write the point CSV, a descriptive correlation number, a PNG scatter, and a write-up that says the number is not a cause. No fit line as policy. No PII point labels. Small n said. If scipy.stats is missing, pandas or numpy correlation is enough — ask rather than fake a p-value file. They decide what the association means.

Starter work map. Replace tools and checks when they **teach**.
