# Wholesale pack day

Build the pick list from standing filtered to the weekday on their calendar, plus dated extras or standing-changes they filed. Do not invent a crate qty or a delivery day. Keep cafe case off the crates unless they asked. Route stops copy the route sheet if they use one. Write-up is the pack list plus 86-wholesale and qty fights. They pack and drive.

Starter work map. Replace tools and checks when they **teach**.
