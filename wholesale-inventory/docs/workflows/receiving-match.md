# Receiving match

Match purchase order versus packing slip versus dock count. Flag shorts, overs, damage, extra lines, UOM mismatches, and missing tickets. No invented PO. ASN is a plan, not a receipt. BOL is not a line count and not a customs clearance. Keep lot or serial if the master requires them. You do not hide a short, mark received in full, or send money. Quote the PDFs and CSVs you used and say which file was absent.

Starter work map. Replace tools and checks when they **teach**.
