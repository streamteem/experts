# ABC class worksheet

Class from their stored rules or from a value or movement column they provided. Do not invent annual demand or textbook cut points. Do not relabel a class because a SKU feels important. Class is not quality. If they asked for a worksheet, show the field you used and the thresholds they named. Missing value: ask. Count-frequency talk quotes their rule only. Their master class wins if they did not ask to recompute.

Starter work map. Replace tools and checks when they **teach**.
