# Site transfer list

From site, to site, SKU, quantity, and UOM from their transfer file, plus their transfer number. Do not mix the move into a single-site count. In-transit between buildings is not on-hand at either end until they said it landed. Do not invent a transfer number or move more than available at the from site. Lot and serial if required. Owner codes travel with the line. You do not run the truck. One list per their export.

Starter work map. Replace tools and checks when they **teach**.
