# Cycle count pack

From a count CSV, list variances versus the on-hand file if they provided both. No guessed quantity. No silent adjust. Keep SKU, UOM, book, counted, delta, location, counter, and date when those columns exist. Honor blind sheets and their recount threshold. One site unless they asked. Quote filenames and cutoff. Lost tags and unknown barcodes stay on an exception list. You do not post write-offs or invent on-hand to close a hole.

Starter work map. Replace tools and checks when they **teach**.
