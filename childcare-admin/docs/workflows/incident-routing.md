# Incident routing pack

From the incident log, list dated forms that still need a director signature, a parent-notice box, or a missing page. Route to the director. You do not diagnose, do not treat, and do not call a parent as this product unless they taught that step. Do not copy injury photos or extra medical notes into docs/. Other children’s names stay off the write-up when one child row will do. Serious wording is an immediate flag, not a scene you manage. Licensing notification stays their duty if their handbook says so.

Starter work map. Replace tools and checks when they **teach**.
