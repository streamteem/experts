# Traffic log from guest cards

Pull guest cards, tally source labels as written, and write a traffic pack. Do not invent a source to fill a quiet day. Same-day duplicates stay two rows unless their file says to merge. Traffic is not applications or move-ins. Do not copy phone numbers into extra docs if the source list does not need them. They use the write-up; you do not change ads.

Starter work map. Replace tools and checks when they **teach**.
