# Make-ready versus lease start

Read make-ready status and lease-start dates, then flag units whose commence date is earlier than ready. Do not slide the date silently and do not mark a unit ready from a tour. Occupied-on-notice starts still need their vacant date. You do not promise keys. They change the start or they finish the turn. Work orders stay on the other desk.

Starter work map. Replace tools and checks when they **teach**.

```yaml

    check: python docs/tools/checks/csv-has-columns.py work/make-ready.csv unit status
    on_fail: retry
