# Delivery today

List jobs that should leave today from the delivery log and matching tickets: method, ship-to, carton or pallet count, and POD if they collect one. Do not invent a delivery day. Short drops stay short. Split ships need a row per drop. You do not pay a carrier and you do not store PAN. Write-up is today's route or will-call list plus qty fights.

Starter work map. Replace tools and checks when they **teach**.
