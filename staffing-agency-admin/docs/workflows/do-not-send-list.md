# Do-not-send list

From the employee list and client list, print people flagged DNS or DNR with the scope they coded — one site versus all. Do not invent a flag. Do not fire anyone. Do not write a legal reason. Background dates stay dates, not a verdict you stamp. Write the blocked list and a write-up so the assignment board can filter. They own the flags. You list who is not to be sent.

Starter work map. Replace tools and checks when they **teach**.
