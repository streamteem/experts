# Open job orders

Index the job-order folder and client list. List orders they still code as open or partial-fill: client, shift, remaining headcount as they count filled, start window, and missing description or rate pointers. Do not invent an order. Do not close an order to improve fill. Do not build a CRM pipeline. Write the open list and a write-up. They fill. Cancelled and on-hold stay as they coded them.

Starter work map. Replace tools and checks when they **teach**.
