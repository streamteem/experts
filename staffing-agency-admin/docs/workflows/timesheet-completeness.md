# Timesheet completeness

For the period they named, join assignments that should have hours to the timesheet CSV. List missing files, missing punches, blank totals, and missing client-sign or approval ticks. Do not invent hours. Do not approve. Do not decide overtime as law. If punches and signed totals disagree, quote both and ask. Write the completeness list and a write-up. They chase the site. No portal password and no SSN in docs/.

Starter work map. Replace tools and checks when they **teach**.
