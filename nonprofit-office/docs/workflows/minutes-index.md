# Minutes index

Index meeting dates and draft versus adopted from their minutes folder. Do not edit adopted minutes in place. Do not promote a draft to adopted. Do not invent attendance or votes. Committee files stay labeled committee. Least PII in the index. Missing adopted minutes for a calendar date are holes. Output is the index CSV and a write-up the next board pack can use. They adopt minutes. You label and list. A corrections process, if they have one, comes from their policy file—not from a silent overwrite.

Starter work map. Replace tools and checks when they **teach**.
