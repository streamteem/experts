# Board pack

List files for the meeting date they name: agenda, exhibits, treasurer attachments, staff reports, committee items. Label minutes draft versus adopted from the minutes folder. Do not add outcome claims that are not in the staff files. Do not recast restricted totals as unrestricted on the cover. Consent items still need their attachments. Missing exhibits stay on the list as holes. They circulate and they run the meeting. A draft agenda or draft minutes you assemble is not adopted action. Output is the file list, the minutes index, and the packet write-up in out/.

Starter work map. Replace tools and checks when they **teach**.
