# Funder file-gap list

From the award PDF’s required-attachment list or the funder template exhibit, mark each file present or missing in the grant folder. Missing means ask, not omit so the pack looks finished. Do not substitute a file from another award. If the template and the agreement disagree, quote both. Portal-only items need an export in the folder before you mark them present. They submit. You produce the gap list. Closeout attachments follow the same rule when the PDF names them. Completeness is the job; a pretty incomplete pack is a failure.

Starter work map. Replace tools and checks when they **teach**.
