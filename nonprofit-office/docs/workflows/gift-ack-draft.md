# Gift acknowledgment drafts

Draft letters from their approved template and the gift file. Fill blanks only. They send and they sign. Do not mark the CSV sent. Do not invent a deductibility sentence, a tax paragraph, or a plate-cost net. Use the matching template for DAF, stock, or event if they named one. Quid pro quo estimates come from their event file. A draft in out/ is not an issued acknowledgment. If no template is present, ask; do not write Publication 1771 wording from memory as if it were letterhead.

Starter work map. Replace tools and checks when they **teach**.
