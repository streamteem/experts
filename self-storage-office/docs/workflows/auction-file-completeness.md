# Auction-file completeness

Compare their auction checklist to files in the folder: notices, certified-mail log, inventory form, photos, calendar date, buyer log. Mark missing in those words. Do not invent a sale date or a bid. Do not say they may auction or that a lien attached. Completeness is not permission to sell. Late-list membership is not an auction file. They and their counsel decide. You write the gap pack only.
