# Move-in packet completeness

Check the agreement folder against their move-in checklist: agreement PDF, rate from the rate file, ID present under min-necessary, insurance form or waiver if they require it. Do not invent a prorate, promo, or tax. Do not write a gate code. If the unit is still occupied or auction-hold on occupancy, flag the clash. Unsigned drafts stay drafts. They take payment and they issue access. You list present-or-missing.

Starter work map. Replace tools and checks when they **teach**.
