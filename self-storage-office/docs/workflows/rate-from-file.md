# Rates from their file

Tabulate street, web, in-place, and promo rates from the rate file they saved. Blank cells stay blank and become asks. Do not invent a size band or a first-month special. Expired promos stay labeled expired. If the occupancy export shows a different in-place rate, quote both. Tax stays on their tax file. They approve any number they will say. You do not send a rate letter.

Starter work map. Replace tools and checks when they **teach**.
