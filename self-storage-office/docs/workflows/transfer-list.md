# Transfer list

List open unit transfers from their spreadsheet or occupancy notes: old unit, new unit, date, and whether a new agreement PDF exists. Do not invent a prorate or the new rate. If the new unit is still occupied on the export, flag the clash. Gate access follows the new unit as process, never a code. Combo adds stay labeled if that is their reason. They approve the swap. You pack leftovers and missing agreements.

Starter work map. Replace tools and checks when they **teach**.
