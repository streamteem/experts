# Late list pack

From payment-status and their late export, list units coded past due with paid-through or days late as they printed. Do not invent a late fee. Do not say a lien attached or that they may auction. Overlock is a status if they coded it, never a code in docs. Autopay failed is a flag, not a card you rerun. Military flags stay visible if present. They contact occupants. You pack the list and fee-file asks.

Starter work map. Replace tools and checks when they **teach**.

```yaml
id: late-list
steps:
  - id: status
    needs: []
    produces: pay
    produce_path: work/payment-status.csv
    tool: docs/tools/payment-status-export.md
    check: python docs/tools/checks/csv-has-columns.py work/payment-status.csv unit status
    on_fail: retry
    next: [late]
  - id: late
