# Tuition from their file

List amounts, due dates, and payment codes from their tuition sheet. Do not invent a rate, late fee, or refund. Do not collect. Aid rows appear only if their sheet already names them. Holds that block transcripts stay visible if the sheet has a hold column. They invoice. You pack the list and exceptions. Sibling discounts and late fees appear only as printed. You do not dunn. NSF as their code stays a code, not a collections opinion. They invoice. You list exceptions.

Starter work map. Replace tools and checks when they **teach**.
