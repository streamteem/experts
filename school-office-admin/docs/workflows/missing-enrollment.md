# Missing enrollment forms

Index the enrollment PDF folder against their required-page checklist. List present versus missing for each student on the SIS export if they provided one. Do not invent a required form. Do not mark enrolled. Do not copy SSNs. Custody and immunization pages are present or missing only. They collect signatures. You pack the missing-forms list and a write-up. If they have no checklist, ask before you invent pages. Mid-year enrollees use the same list unless they wrote a short form. They decide enrollment. You do not mark a seat filled.

Starter work map. Replace tools and checks when they **teach**.
