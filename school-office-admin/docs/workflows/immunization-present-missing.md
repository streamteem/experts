# Immunization present versus missing

Compare their immunization log to packet PDFs. List complete, incomplete, exempt-as-filed, or stale as they coded it. Apply their deadline file if present; do not invent exclusion law. Do not read shots as a clinician. Clinic-day returns count only as they logged them. They notify families. You pack the present-missing list. Do not stamp compliant. New enrollees and grade-entry deadlines may differ if their file splits them. They notify. You do not exclude a child at the door.

Starter work map. Replace tools and checks when they **teach**.
