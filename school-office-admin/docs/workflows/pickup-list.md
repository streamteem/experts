# Pickup list check

Build a door or aftercare check from their pickup file. Flag names on early-dismissal notes that are not on the list, and flag custody-file mismatches if they also dropped that PDF. Do not add a name. Do not release a child. Min necessary on the printed sheet. They train the door. You pack exceptions. Aftercare and bus sheets compare to the same list unless they split files. You do not release anyone. Verbal door claims are not rows. They update names.

Starter work map. Replace tools and checks when they **teach**.
