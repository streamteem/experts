# Hold versus definite list

Build one list of tentative holds and definite bookings for the same date range. Keep status as they coded it. Flag same room-date conflicts and first-option versus second-option from their sheet. Do not upgrade a hold. Do not invent a cutoff or a room rate. Missing contract pointers on rows marked definite stay visible. They release or they sign. You hand a list plus write-up, not a live calendar change.

Starter work map. Replace tools and checks when they **teach**.

```yaml

steps:
  - id: holds

    check: python docs/tools/checks/csv-has-columns.py work/holds.csv date room status
    on_fail: retry
    next: [defs]
