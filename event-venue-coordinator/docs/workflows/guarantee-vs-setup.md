# Guarantee versus setup

Compare the guarantee or labeled expected count on each BEO to chair and table counts on the dated diagram. Flag disagreements and any count above posted occupancy on their inventory or placard file if that number is in the BEO pack notes. Do not invent a guarantee. Do not stamp fire capacity. They revise the diagram or the count. You deliver the comparison list plus write-up.

Starter work map. Replace tools and checks when they **teach**.
