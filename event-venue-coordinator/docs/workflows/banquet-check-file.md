# Banquet check versus BEO

Compare each banquet-check PDF to the matching BEO for menu, counts, extras, service charge, and tax as their tax file. List mismatches and unsigned checks. Do not invent a tax rate. Do not mark paid. Do not store PAN. Guarantee versus actual follows their contract file only. They present the check. You deliver the exception pack plus write-up. Unsigned checks and tax lines that disagree with their tax file stay on the exception list. Incidentals need a captain slip when their process requires one. They present the check; you do not store PAN or mark paid.

Starter work map. Replace tools and checks when they **teach**.
