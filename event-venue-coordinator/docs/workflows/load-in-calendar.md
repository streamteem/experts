# Load-in calendar

Build a dock, elevator, and vendor arrival calendar from the timeline sheet and BEO time blocks. Flag overlaps and blank load-in on vendor-heavy days. Do not invent a default window. Do not write door codes. Load-out that hits the next setup stays on the conflict list. They assign slots. You deliver the calendar plus write-up. Freight-elevator windows and dock bays stay on separate columns when their sheets split them. Next-event setup after a late strike remains a conflict. They assign the slot; you do not invent a default two-hour load-in.

Starter work map. Replace tools and checks when they **teach**.
