# Holiday coverage pack

Read their holiday calendar against the schedule and roster. List sites that skip, sites that still run, and extra-day rows that already have auth. Do not invent a federal skip or a party night. Quote company versus customer calendar conflicts. Crew names come from the roster only. Write-up is coverage holes plus questions. They call the customer. You do not declare the building closed.

Starter work map. Replace tools and checks when they **teach**.
