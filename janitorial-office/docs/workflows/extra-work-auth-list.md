# Extra-work authorization list

Match add-on, extra-day, and project rows on the schedule to an auth PDF in the contract folder. Missing auth stays a hold. Do not invent a price. Do not treat a verbal as filed. Courtesy callbacks stay labeled if they coded them. Write-up is present versus missing auth plus which schedule rows wait. They collect signatures. You pack the list the check can see.

Starter work map. Replace tools and checks when they **teach**.

```yaml
