# Site-night list

Build a night list from their site list, schedule CSV, and crew roster: site, shift, crew, area-split if they have one, and miss flags. Apply holiday skips only from their calendar if it is already in the folder; otherwise leave holiday as a question. Do not invent hours, wages, or a missing site. Never put alarm codes on the board. One site or area per row. They dispatch. You write the list and a short write-up the check can see.

Starter work map. Replace tools and checks when they **teach**.
