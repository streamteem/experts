# LOTO form present

For work orders that their export or rule file marks as needing lockout, index whether a machine-specific procedure PDF sits in the procedure folder. List present or missing. Do not write isolation steps. Do not stamp OSHA. Do not say the lockout was performed. Write-up is a completeness list plus which assets have no file, not a safety inspection and not a PE energy study.

Starter work map. Replace tools and checks when they **teach**.
