# Parts below minimum

Compare crib on-hand to the min-qty they stored. List SKUs at or below min. Do not invent a min or a count. Do not place a PO. Do not hide a hole so the crib looks healthy. Kit and spare flags stay as they coded them. Write-up is a below-min pack plus which open work orders wait on those SKUs if the work-order file is in the folder.

Starter work map. Replace tools and checks when they **teach**.
