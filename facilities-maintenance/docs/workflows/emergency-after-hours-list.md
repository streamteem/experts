# Emergency and after-hours list

List tickets they coded emergency or after-hours, then attach the after-hours vendor or on-call names from their contractor list and any silent-hours or holiday notes on the plant calendar. Do not invent a vendor. Do not store alarm codes. Do not promote a routine ticket. Write-up is a morning recap pack: who is down, who is on the list, and which calendar window applies, not a diagnosis.

Starter work map. Replace tools and checks when they **teach**.
