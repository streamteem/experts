# Wait-list pack

From their wait-list file, keep their order and requested type and doctor. Match open or cancelled slots from the day list or calendar only as listed options. They choose who is offered. You do not message patients and you do not invent that someone was reached. Emergency wording flags staff and is not a diagnosis. Extra phones the send-list does not need stay out of the write-up. Prefer chart number. Exam types and optical types stay as stored. Do not reorder to favor a vision plan or a frame sale.

Starter work map. Replace tools and checks when they **teach**.
