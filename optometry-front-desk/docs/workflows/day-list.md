# Day list

From the schedule export, list the day by time, doctor, type, and their patient label. Keep closed blocks, lunch, huddle, and optical-only rows. Flag dilation and contact-training flags as stored. Flag emergency wording for staff. No clinical notes, no diagnosis from the reason field, and no Rx interpretation. One clinic date and one location unless they asked for a multi-day book and the file has a date column. Prefer chart or account number. Confirm the export date before you treat it as tomorrow. This is an optometry book, not a dental chair sheet.

Starter work map. Replace tools and checks when they **teach**.
