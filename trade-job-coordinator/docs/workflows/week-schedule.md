# Week board and conflicts

Week view: crew PTO, overbook, sold installs without parts. Ask before moving a customer window. Join the board export to the tech calendar they provided. Two-person and weather-hold flags, if their SOP names them, are conflicts when the helper is off or the hold is live. Do not cancel a membership to fit a sold install without asking. Do not invent capacity policy. List each collision with job id and issue. Parts promise slips belong here as questions, not silent delays. Their headers win.

Starter work map. Replace tools and checks when they **teach**.
