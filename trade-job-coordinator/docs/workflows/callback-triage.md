# Callback triage

List returns to recent jobs. Flag warranty versus billable per their marks. Do not admit legal fault. Same symptom inside their window is a flag before the row is booked as new revenue. Quote original and return job ids and the symptom in their words. Labor and parts clocks differ; do not extend either. Missing bill mark is a question for the person who owns pricing. Do not invent no-charge. The write-up keeps callbacks off the new-sale pile. Their type codes win.

Starter work map. Replace tools and checks when they **teach**.
