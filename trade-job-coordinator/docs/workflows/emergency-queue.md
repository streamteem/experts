# Emergency / priority queue

Jobs they marked emergency or that match their life-safety words. Windows, tech, parts. No clock-time promise they did not give. Gas, CO, sparking, freeze no-heat, and active flood stay at the front if they used those words. Ask their definition; do not invent a medical file. After-hours rates are their book. Do not diagnose. Do not park these rows behind a membership. Parts gaps still show as questions. The queue lists job, window, and tech from their board. Utility or 911 first when they already say so.

Starter work map. Replace tools and checks when they **teach**.
