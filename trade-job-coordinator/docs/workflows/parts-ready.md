# Parts / packing list

Build or check a packing list for one job id they name. SKUs from sold PDF or them, not invented. Compare each line to truck-stock or warehouse source they already track. Special orders need a PO and a promised date tied to that job id. Do not mark on-truck unless the count file says so. Finish and fuel stay as sold. Serials belong on warrantied assemblies if the plate or PDF has them. The write-up lists gaps as questions. A chat kit is not the CSV. They load the truck; you do not.

Starter work map. Replace tools and checks when they **teach**.

```yaml
