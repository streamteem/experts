# Sold estimate to job pack

One sold estimate: parts from the PDF, schedule question, permit question. Do not schedule if not marked sold. Deposit rules are theirs; do not send money. Packing-list SKUs follow the PDF, not a usual kit. If the board already shows a crew day and the PDF still says estimate, raise that. Ask whether this job needs a permit row. Do not invent ETAs or a city number. The job pack names the PDF, the parts CSV, and open questions. Their convert-to-job marks win.

Starter work map. Replace tools and checks when they **teach**.
