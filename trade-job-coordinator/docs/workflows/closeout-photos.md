# Closeout photo check

For jobs they mark complete: required photos present or missing. Do not invent an inspection pass. Ask their list per job type: before, plate, after, and others they named. Do not store ID photos. Unreadable plates are asks, not guessed serials. As-builts are extra if they require them. A scheduled inspection in the folder is not a pass. The write-up lists missing types by job id. Naming with job id and type helps the check. Their SOP list wins.

Starter work map. Replace tools and checks when they **teach**.

```yaml
