# Permit numbers on file

For jobs they marked as needing a permit: number, AHJ, dates. Do not say passed unless the file says passed and dated. Scheduled is not passed. Copy applied, issued, and result-as-written from the card or screenshot they saved. HOA paper is a second row if they track it. Do not invent a number or a city. You do not inspect. Correction lists stay as written. Missing number on a flagged job is a question. The pack quotes their file only.

Starter work map. Replace tools and checks when they **teach**.
