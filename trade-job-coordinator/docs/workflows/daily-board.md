# Day’s jobs

From their schedule file, list today's jobs, assigned tech, and missing packing lists. Do not invent ETAs. Typical US SMB boards also show job type and city; copy those columns as they named them. Installs without a CSV the check can see stay questions, not ready-to-roll. Service may run on truck stock; ask their rule rather than inventing policy. Windows stay the blocks they sold. Emergency rows keep their priority mark. Write the day's pack so gaps are visible before the truck leaves. No clock time they did not give.

Starter work map. Replace tools and checks when they **teach**.
