# Class roster

Build the roster for named classes from the schedule file plus check-ins or bookings they exported. Capacity comes only from the schedule. Do not overbook unless their file allows it. Waitlist rows stay off the booked count. Holiday hours beat a leftover series class. Produce the roster plus a write-up. They teach the class. Starter until they teach this studio’s live schedule file.

Starter work map. Replace tools and checks when they **teach**.
