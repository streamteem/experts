# Missing waivers

Compare the membership export to the waiver folder. List members and guests whose required form is absent. PAR-Q is present-or-missing only — do not score answers. Minors need the guardian form their packet names. Do not invent a signature. Produce the missing-forms CSV plus a write-up. They chase signatures. Do not score a PAR-Q or copy medical answers into docs/. Starter until they teach this club’s current form versions.

Starter work map. Replace tools and checks when they **teach**.
