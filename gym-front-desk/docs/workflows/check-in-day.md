# Day check-in list

Build today’s check-in list from their scan export. Join access flags so denied or frozen rows stay visible. Do not invent a visit and do not clear a deny. Guests without a pass row stay exceptions. Kid-area scans stay on their file unless they taught a merge. Hours file still does not create a check-in. Produce the list plus a write-up. They greet and they override. Starter until they teach this club’s scan columns.

Starter work map. Replace tools and checks when they **teach**.
