# Failed-draft list

List failed drafts from the membership or billing export they dropped: amount as printed, fail date, and reason code if present. Do not invent NSF versus expired card. Do not retry the draft and do not store PAN. They contact the member. Produce the list plus a write-up. Access after a fail stays their flag, not a hold you invent. Starter until they teach this club’s fail and retry codes.

Starter work map. Replace tools and checks when they **teach**.
