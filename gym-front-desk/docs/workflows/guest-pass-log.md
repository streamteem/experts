# Guest-pass log

Build the guest-pass log from check-ins plus the membership export for host rows if their file requires a host. Waiver present stays a join to the waiver folder when they asked. Do not invent a free pass or write a guest onto the member roster. Produce the log plus a write-up. They sell the day pass. Starter until they teach this club’s guest rules.

Starter work map. Replace tools and checks when they **teach**.
