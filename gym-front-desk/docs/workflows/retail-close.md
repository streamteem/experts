# Retail close

Close retail from their count-and-price sheet plus the day-close tender export. Keep backbar off the sold pile if they split bins. Do not invent a price, a bottle count, or a cash-drawer total. Counted cash is a number they type after they count. No diet advice on shake SKUs. Produce the close pack plus a write-up. They sell and they count the drawer. Starter until they teach this club’s official close report.
