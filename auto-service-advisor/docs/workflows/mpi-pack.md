# MPI from their form

Copy red, yellow, green, or their tags and photo captions from their inspection export only. Not a state inspection and not a pass sticker. Do not invent a 50-point list. Recommendations need their prices before they go to a findings call, and they stay unsold without auth. Describe only attached photos. A caption is not a diagnosis unless the tech wrote one. Independent DVI and dealer factory MPI both count. Missing export means ask. Do not say the car is safe because boxes are green.

Starter work map. Replace tools and checks when they **teach**.
