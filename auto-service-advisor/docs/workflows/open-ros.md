# Open ROs

List open tickets from their board export or screenshot. One row per RO with their status, promised time, and hold reason. Flag missing authorization, parts holds from their files, and comebacks when history is in the folder. No invented status and no invented ready time. Waiters stay waiters. If the export lacks a column, ask. Do not diagnose. Do not stamp safe or street-legal. Independent and dealer boards both work this way until they teach their status words.

Starter work map. Replace tools and checks when they **teach**.
