# New-hire completeness

Read their new-hire checklist sheet and the packet folder. Mark each row present, missing, or not-applicable as they allow. Pull I-9 section dates from the index as dates only. Start date, title, and wage come from their offer or hire sheet — do not invent them. No SSN, no account numbers, no ID images in docs/. Write the missing-forms list and a short write-up. They collect the missing pages. You do not clear the person to work as counsel.

Starter work map. Replace tools and checks when they **teach**.
