# Customer-pay versus insurer

Split estimate lines by the pay type they coded: insurer, deductible as posted, and customer-pay. Do not roll CP into insurer totals. Do not invent a CP price or a deductible. Write-up is the split plus asks, not a card you run and not a coverage opinion. Distinct from a mechanical customer-pay-versus-policy RO pack. Deductible stays as posted, not as CP, unless they coded it that way. You do not invent a split. Write-up names the pay column. You do not store PAN to collect either side.
