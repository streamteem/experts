# Records-release log

From the ROI folder and their release log, list request date, requester type as they coded, ROI present or missing, and send status as recorded. You do not release records and you do not copy the chart into docs/. Third-party rows still need their form. Fees come only from their records-fee sheet. Expired ROI dates stay questions. Prefer chart label. They ship. You pack the completeness list plus a write-up.

Starter work map. Replace tools and checks when they **teach**.

```yaml
id: records-release-log
steps:
  - id: roi

    check: python docs/tools/checks/file-exists.py work/roi-index.csv
    on_fail: retry
    next: [log]
