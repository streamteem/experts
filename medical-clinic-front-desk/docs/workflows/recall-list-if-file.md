# Recall list if they have a file

If they exported a recall or reminder list, shape it: chart label, due date as stored, type as they labeled it. They send reminders. You do not message patients and you do not invent a due date from a generic annual habit. If they have no recall export, say the file is missing — do not build one from memory. Hours and holiday blocks still apply when they asked you to propose slots. Prefer chart number. Extra clinical notes stay out of docs/.

Starter work map. Replace tools and checks when they **teach**.

```yaml

  - id: pull

    check: python docs/tools/checks/file-exists.py work/recall.csv
    on_fail: retry
    next: [columns]
  - id: columns
