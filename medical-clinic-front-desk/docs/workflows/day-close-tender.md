# Day-close tender

From their close report or drawer sheet, list tender types and amounts they recorded for one clinic date. Do not store PAN or check account numbers. Do not send a deposit or mark a bill paid. Short-or-over versus their expected total is a flag from their math, not a silent fix. Copay posted amounts, if compared, come from their posted copay sheet — do not invent expected collect. Insurance posting is not tender. One location unless they asked.

Starter work map. Replace tools and checks when they **teach**.
