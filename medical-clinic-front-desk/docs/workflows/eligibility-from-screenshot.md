# Eligibility from screenshot

Quote only the dated screenshot or clearinghouse print they saved: plan name, active wording, copay or deductible sentences as printed, image date. No screenshot: ask. Do not invent remaining benefits and do not promise the plan will pay. If the image is cropped, stale, or for the wrong member, ask for a dated full page. Least PHI on the quote sheet. They verify; you do not log into the payer portal. Card images are not eligibility.
