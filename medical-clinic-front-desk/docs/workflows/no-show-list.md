# No-show list

From the day-list or EHR export, list rows they already coded no-show, late cancel, or broken. Do not infer a no-show from a blank confirmation. Do not invent a fee or a dismissal rule. Keep their status words. One clinic date unless they asked for a range and the file has dates. Prefer chart number. They decide who is offered a wait-list fill. You do not diagnose why the patient missed.

Starter work map. Replace tools and checks when they **teach**.

```yaml

steps:
  - id: pull
    needs: []

    produce_path: work/day-list.csv
    tool: docs/tools/ehr-export.md
    check: python docs/tools/checks/file-exists.py work/day-list.csv
    on_fail: retry
    next: [columns]
  - id: columns
    needs: [day]
    produces: day-cols
    produce_path: work/day-list.csv
    tool: docs/tools/ehr-export.md
