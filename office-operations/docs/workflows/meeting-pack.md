# Meeting pack

Agenda plus open actions from last minutes. They send anything to people. Keep their meeting label; a staff huddle is not a board book. Do not invent decisions or assign owners to punish. Unclear owner: ask. Attachments are files they already named. Public or leftover printouts omit personal phones if they said a guest might see them. Draft stays in work/ and out/. Starter pack shape until they teach this shop's template.

Starter work map. Replace tools and checks when they **teach**.
