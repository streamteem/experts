# Supply list

Build or update a supply CSV for them to order. Flag at or below their min. Do not buy, open a cart, or invent a min or SKU. Brand lines come from their last invoice. Kitchen and postage follow the same no-order rule if those rows are on the sheet. Office stock stays off the warehouse count unless they taught one list. Missing on-hand: ask whether they count that item. The write-up is a flag list they can act on; you do not place the vendor order.

Starter work map. Replace tools and checks when they **teach**.
