# License and insurance dates

Expire dates from their tracker or certificate images. Flag past or blank. No compliance stamp and no filing with a city or carrier. Copy policy type and dates from the binder; do not pick coverage or say a claim is covered. Missing scan pages: say missing. Insurance and license rows may share the tracker if they already do. This is orientation paperwork, not a legal or payroll-tax opinion. Ask which file is current when two dates disagree.

Starter work map. Replace tools and checks when they **teach**.
