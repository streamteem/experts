# Weekly office pack

From their task sheet and calendar export, list this week's items and missing files. One week unless they asked to combine. Confirm week start if the export and wall calendar disagree. Do not add meetings they did not export. Conflicts: list both and ask. Owners stay as they wrote; blank owner is a question, not a name you pick. Draft the write-up as a file; they send anything to people. Starter notes, not this shop's proven ritual until they teach.

Starter work map. Replace tools and checks when they **teach**.
