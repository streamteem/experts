# Office vendor list pack

Contacts and renewal months from their file. Do not invent phones, account numbers, or a website listing as their account. List company, service, and dates they stored. W-9 may be a present flag without a full TIN in the pack. You do not pay, cancel, or pick a winner. Notice windows are copied dates, not legal readings. Two vendors for one service: list both. Starter facilities list until they teach this shop's contacts.

Starter work map. Replace tools and checks when they **teach**.
