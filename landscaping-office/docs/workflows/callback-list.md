# Callback list

List open callbacks from tickets they coded as return or complaint. Attach named photos if present. Do not diagnose turf or trees. Do not promise survival. Warranty versus courtesy versus billable follows their file. Hours come from their sheet, not invented time. Skip and dog flags still apply. They schedule the return. You write the list and questions, not a customer apology as if you were the owner.

Starter work map. Replace tools and checks when they **teach**.

```yaml
