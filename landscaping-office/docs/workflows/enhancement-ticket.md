# Enhancement ticket pack

Assemble one-time work from the enhancement ticket, price file, and sold proposal if present. Extra finds still need auth. Commercial PO missing when required stays a hold. Do not mix this onto the weekly mow row. Materials and hours come from their files only. Warranty language is copied, not a survival promise. They schedule the enhancement crew. You draft the pack and write-up.

Starter work map. Replace tools and checks when they **teach**.
