# Photo pack

Index photos they stored to ticket and property. Keep or propose names that match their rule. Do not invent a shot or crop away a defect. Proposal photos stay with the estimate draft; after photos stay with closeout or callbacks. Min-necessary on faces and plates. Photos are not a disease label. They shoot again if a view is missing. You write the index and write-up the check can see.

Starter work map. Replace tools and checks when they **teach**.
