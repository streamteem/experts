# CD and LE present

List Loan Estimate and Closing Disclosure versions in their LE/CD folder with issued dates as printed. Do not draft a disclosure. Do not invent a rate or a fee. Do not give a TRID legal opinion. Do not copy a full SSN. If lock file and CD disagree on rate, quote both after the lock file is in the pack. Write-up is a version list, not advice.

Starter work map. Replace tools and checks when they **teach**.
