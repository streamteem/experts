# Eligibility screenshot notes

Quote in-network, deductible, and remaining maximum only as the dated screenshot shows. Ask if the image is missing or stale. Do not call the payer. Do not invent a remaining maximum from chat or a similar employer. Frequency sentences are quoted text, not a clinical due date and not a CDT choice. Do not promise benefits will pay. Quote the dental block they pointed to. Least PHI: the figures they asked for, not extra member identifiers.

Starter work map. Replace tools and checks when they **teach**.
