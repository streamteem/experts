# End-of-day manifest

Compare live label PDFs to the carrier manifest export. Voided labels must not appear as tendered. Holds and will-calls stay off the street manifest. Do not invent a pickup confirmation or a close timestamp. Missing manifest file: say missing, do not mark the day closed. They click close. You do not pay daily pickup fees. Will-call and hold-for-pickup must not appear as street tenders. Unmanifested live labels are exceptions. They click close in the tool. You do not invent a driver pickup name.

Starter work map. Replace tools and checks when they **teach**.
