# Pack exceptions

Compare the pack export to the pick file. List short packs, extra packs, unknown carton codes versus the carton-size sheet, and missing scale weights. Do not invent packed qty. Do not write shipped-complete on a short. Kit components that do not match their kit notes stay listed. They decide reship or backorder. You prepare the exception write-up. Carton codes that are not on the size sheet stay listed. Missing scale weight is an ask, not a guessed pound. They decide reship or backorder. You do not hide a short inside packed-complete.

Starter work map. Replace tools and checks when they **teach**.
