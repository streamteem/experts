# Tracking exceptions

From the carrier export, list exception codes, failed delivery, and trackers that never appeared after a label PDF. Do not invent a tracking number or a delivered time. Voided labels stay off the live list. Do not promise a new delivery day. POD presence is yes/no from their file. They call the carrier. You do not pay a claim. Multi-piece orders missing one tracker stay listed piece by piece. You do not invent POD. They call the carrier. Claim dollars stay off this pack unless they asked for a separate claim-file routing.

Starter work map. Replace tools and checks when they **teach**.
