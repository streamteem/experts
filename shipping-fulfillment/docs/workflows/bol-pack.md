# BOL pack

Assemble a bill-of-lading completeness pack from their BOL PDF, scale export, and NMFC file. Copy weight and class only when those files have them. Ask on missing ship-to, piece count, or prepaid/collect/third-party. Never invent NMFC class or weight. Never sign as hazmat certifier. They tender. You do not pay the freight bill. Third-party account blanks stay asks. Hazmat lines need their hazmat file and still get no certifier stamp from you. They tender the freight. You never pay the carrier.

Starter work map. Replace tools and checks when they **teach**.
