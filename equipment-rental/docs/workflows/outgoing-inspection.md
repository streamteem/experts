# Outgoing inspection completeness

For units leaving today, check outgoing inspection sheets against the fleet row: meter, fuel, kit, manual present, photos if required. Do not invent hours or fuel. Do not diagnose. Missing required serial or blank meter is an ask. Licensed-operator ask completeness follows their form only — no license stamp. Pack the incompletes and the write-up. They hold the gate. Indoor-height asks stay questions, not engineering. Card PAN does not belong on the sheet.

Starter work map. Replace tools and checks when they **teach**.
