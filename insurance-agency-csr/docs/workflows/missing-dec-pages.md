# Missing dec pages

Compare the AMS policy list to the dec-page folder. List issued or in-force rows with no current-term dec PDF. Do not invent limits to stand in for a missing dec. Do not say those policies are covered. Pending new business without a number stays pending, not missing-dec, unless they asked you to treat binder files as the stand-in and the binder is also missing. They pull decs. You keep the gap list.

Starter work map. Replace tools and checks when they **teach**.
