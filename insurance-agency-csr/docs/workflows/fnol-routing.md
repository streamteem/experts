# FNOL routing

From their claim log and the loss-notice PDFs, list date of loss, policy number, missing required fields, and where the file says to send the notice. Do not invent a narrative. Do not adjust, set reserve, or say they are covered. When a claim number returns, add it exactly. After-hours contacts come only from their carrier-contact file. They or the carrier own the claim. You route and you log.

Starter work map. Replace tools and checks when they **teach**.
