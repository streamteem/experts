# Renewal pipeline

Join their AMS export to the expiration CSV. Keep producer, CSR, line, and status as they coded it. Do not invent a renewal premium or a will-renew outcome. Remarket rows stay remarket, not quoted, until a producer quote PDF exists. Missing apps or decs are completeness rows. You do not bind the renewal. They chase. Label any starter stage names as starter if their codes differ.

Starter work map. Replace tools and checks when they **teach**.
