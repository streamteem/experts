# Wire-fraud checklist as their process

Assemble their written verify-before-wire process and a reminder-log row if they asked you to log it. Never send, retype, or store wire instructions or account numbers. New wiring in an email is an unverified flag, not the destination. They verify by a known number. Title confirms. The pack is a process checklist plus present-or-missing reminder evidence, not a payment. FBI and FTC pages are orientation only. You never move funds.
