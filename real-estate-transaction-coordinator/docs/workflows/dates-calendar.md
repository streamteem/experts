# Dates calendar from the contract

Build a dates calendar from the executed contract and any executed amendments. Effective date, option or inspection ends, financing, closing, and possession stay on separate rows with the source page. Do not invent typical days. Business versus calendar labels come from their form or broker note; if missing, ask before you count. Holiday moves wait on their holiday file. Appointment times are not silent new legal dates. They watch the clock. You keep the sheet honest and you do not promise a close.

Starter work map. Replace tools and checks when they **teach**.
