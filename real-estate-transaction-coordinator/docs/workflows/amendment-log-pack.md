# Amendment log pack

Build one dated log of every executed amendment against the live contract file: what changed, old versus new, signatures, and filename. Drafts and emails stay labeled not executed unless their process says otherwise. Do not rewrite the original PDF. Do not invent a credit or a new closing date. If two versions both look signed, quote both and ask which is live. They circulate. You keep the log readable for the dates calendar and the closing checklist.

Starter work map. Replace tools and checks when they **teach**.
