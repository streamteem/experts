# Disclosure completeness

Check the disclosure folder against their checklist: seller statement, lead pamphlet receipt if their year-built file puts the property in scope, and any other named state or local pages. Present, signed, dated, or missing only. Do not fill seller answers. Do not invent a year built. Do not give a condition or fair-housing opinion. Buyer acknowledgments stay separate rows if their form uses them. Their checklist wins over a remembered packet. They complete the forms. You list holes.

Starter work map. Replace tools and checks when they **teach**.
