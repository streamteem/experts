# Closing checklist

Build a closing completeness pack from the closing index, title folder, lender status, and the printed closing and possession dates. Mark CD or settlement versions by date. Do not mark funded or recorded without their confirmation. Do not attach wire instructions. Do not promise they will close. Cash versus financed labels follow the PDFs. Walkthrough and key notes stay as files, not a condition opinion. They and the closer run the table. You name what is still missing.

Starter work map. Replace tools and checks when they **teach**.
