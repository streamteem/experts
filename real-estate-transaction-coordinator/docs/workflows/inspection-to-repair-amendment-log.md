# Inspection to repair-amendment log

Index inspection PDFs by type and date, then list any executed repair amendment that followed. Inspector comments are not contract language. Credits and repair lists come only from signed pages. Unsigned drafts stay drafts. Do not invent a credit to match a bid. Do not steer the next inspector. Show old versus new if a later amendment changed the first. They negotiate. You keep the log. Walkthrough punch items stay off this pack unless they asked to attach them as leftover work.

Starter work map. Replace tools and checks when they **teach**.
