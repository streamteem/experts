# Day list

From the schedule export, list the day by time, therapist, type, and their patient label. Keep closed blocks, lunch, and documentation rows. Flag emergency wording for staff. No treatment notes and no diagnosis from the reason field. One clinic date and one location unless they asked for a multi-day book and the file has a date column. Flag overlaps that their double-book rule does not allow. Prefer chart or MRN. Confirm the export date before you treat it as tomorrow. Do not invent remaining visits on the huddle list.

Starter work map. Replace tools and checks when they **teach**.
