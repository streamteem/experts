# Arrivals day list

Build today’s arrivals list from their CSV and mark ready versus not-ready using the room-status sheet. Do not assign a dirty or OOO room. Do not invent a rate or a room number the export left blank. Early check-in stays an ask. Group and OTA rows keep their source labels. DNR matches against their list are manager asks. They assign rooms and they check guests in. You deliver the list and write-up.

Starter work map. Replace tools and checks when they **teach**.
