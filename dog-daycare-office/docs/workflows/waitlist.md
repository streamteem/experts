# Waitlist pack

From their waitlist sheet and calendar, list order, requested dates, and stay type. Do not jump a row. Do not confirm a stay unless they asked you to draft from their process. Do not invent a peak deposit. Vaccine-file and waiver gates stay present or missing, never a medical due-date. You do not message the list as a blast. Starter / guess until they teach the sort key and who calls the next name.

Starter work map. Replace tools and checks when they **teach**.
