# Missing waiver list

From the waiver folder and the stay list, list dogs whose waiver is unsigned, undated, wrong version, or missing pages. Do not give a legal opinion. Do not skip a trial day unless they wrote an exception. Photo-release pages are separate if their packet splits them. A complete waiver is not a medical clearance. Starter / guess until they teach the current version and e-sign rules.

Starter work map. Replace tools and checks when they **teach**.

```yaml
