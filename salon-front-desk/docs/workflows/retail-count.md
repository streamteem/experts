# Retail vs backbar count

From their count sheet, list on-hand, flag SKUs below par if the sheet has par, and keep retail off the backbar column. Reorder quantities come from the vendor PDF, not a guess. Match SKU and size. Do not place the order or pay the house account. A backbar empty is not a retail sale. If par or case pack is missing, say so and ask. They send the vendor order. Starter until they teach this shop’s bins and vendors.

Starter work map. Replace tools and checks when they **teach**.
