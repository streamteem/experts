# Day’s book

Build tomorrow’s or today’s book from their booking export. Flag stylist clashes, blank providers, and slots outside the hours file. Do not move guests. Pending online rows stay pending. Walk-ins need a slot type they already use. Guest labels stay as exported. Produce the book pack they can read; they contact guests and they decide any move. Hours file beats a stray widget slot. Starter until they teach this floor’s labels.

Starter work map. Replace tools and checks when they **teach**.
