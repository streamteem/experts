# Booth vs employee number split

Using the roster and the POS or book export, list tickets and totals in two piles: house employees versus booth renters. Ask if a provider has no label. Do not merge processor batches. Courtesy house-book listings are not house revenue unless they taught that. You do not give a classification opinion. Rent ledgers stay off this pack unless they asked for a separate rent list. Starter until they teach this floor’s ownership split.

Starter work map. Replace tools and checks when they **teach**.
