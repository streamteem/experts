# Change-order pack

Show the original PO line versus the requested change (quantity, date, price, revision, or ship-to) with the vendor PDF or buyer note that triggered it. They approve. Do not silently edit the open-PO sheet so aging looks right. An acknowledgment that changes terms is a change, not the word confirmed. Old versus new must both appear. You do not send the change as live. Closing short is a separate decision they make in words.

Starter work map. Replace tools and checks when they **teach**.
