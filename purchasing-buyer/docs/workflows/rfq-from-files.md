# RFQ pack from their files

Assemble the item list, quantities, specs or drawings they attached, and need-by from their requisition files. Tabulate quotes only when PDFs arrive in the quote folder; blank cells stay blank. They send the RFQ and they award. You do not pick a winner and you do not email vendors as this product. Same package to each invited vendor if that is their rule. AVL still applies to invitees when they use one. Expired incoming quotes stay labeled expired.

Starter work map. Replace tools and checks when they **teach**.
