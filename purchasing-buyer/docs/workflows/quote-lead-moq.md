# Lead time and MOQ from vendor PDFs

Read the quote PDFs they saved. List unit price, currency as labeled, validity date, MOQ or pack, and lead time as written. Blank fields stay blank and become asks. No guessed prices, breaks, or freight dollars. If the quote is expired, ask before anyone uses the price. Compare to the item master when that export exists; if they disagree, quote both. They decide reuse, a new quote, or a substitute. You do not issue a PO from this pack alone.

Starter work map. Replace tools and checks when they **teach**.
