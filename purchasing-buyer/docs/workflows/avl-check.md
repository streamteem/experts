# AVL check before a PO draft

Check each proposed vendor on the requisition or draft against the approved-vendor list they exported. Not on the list: ask. Do not add the vendor as approved and do not treat a one-time or sole-source note as an AVL add. If they have no AVL, say so. Inactive or conditional status stays as written. The pack is a pass/fail list plus questions, not a live PO. They add names if they choose. Then they approve any later PO.

Starter work map. Replace tools and checks when they **teach**.
