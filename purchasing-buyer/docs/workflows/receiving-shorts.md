# Receiving shorts

From receiving versus open PO quantity, list shorts and partials in those words. Do not write received-in-full. Attach packing-slip notes or photos if they scanned them, and list slip qty when it differs from the dock count. Remaining open qty stays visible. One vendor per rush pack unless they asked otherwise. You do not invent a count and you do not zero the remainder. They send the claim to the vendor.

Starter work map. Replace tools and checks when they **teach**.
