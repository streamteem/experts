# Blanket release draft

Draft a release against the blanket log: keep the blanket number on every line, remaining not-to-exceed or remaining qty if they track it, release quantity, and the blanket price file. Do not invent remaining value and do not use a contradicting one-off price without asking. The release stays a draft. They approve and they send. Exceeding remaining NTE is a question, not a quiet extra. Need-by still comes from their requisition or plan, not from a guessed date.

Starter work map. Replace tools and checks when they **teach**.
