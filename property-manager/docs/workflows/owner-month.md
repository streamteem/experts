# Owner monthly pack

Gather the period files they drop for one property and one named date range: cash or bank export, bills, open work orders, and the rent-roll as-of. Assemble categories they already use, then write the pack with property, owner entity, and dates on the front. Do not send owner money, do not mix owners, and do not treat surplus as a draw you ran. Deposit and trust cash stay in the labels they taught. Legal and inspection questions stay questions.

Starter work map. Replace tools and checks when they **teach**.
