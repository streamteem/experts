# Week’s showings

Build the week's tours from their calendar or availability sheet: vacant units, windows, asking rent they set, and any occupied row that is missing a notice log. No steering copy and no invented comps. Do not promise an application will be approved. Do not paste lockbox codes onto the week sheet. If they ask to describe who should apply, refuse. They run the tours; this pack is the schedule plus gaps.

Starter work map. Replace tools and checks when they **teach**.
