# Late rent list (not eviction)

Take balances from the roll or aging export they name. Add questions on partials, NSF reversals, and whether they accept plans — their SOP, not a plan you invent. No pay-or-quit text, no court advice, no lockout language. Do not apply a late fee they did not configure and do not delete an NSF receipt to clean the list. They or counsel send any legal notice. You never collect a card or move deposit cash to cover a balance.

Starter work map. Replace tools and checks when they **teach**.
