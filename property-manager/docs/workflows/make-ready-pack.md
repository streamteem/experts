# Make-ready punch pack

Build the punch for one vacant unit they name, using their checklist, then attach vendor dates from the quote or invoice files they provided. Flag missing photos and items still open. Rent-ready is their label, not an inspection pass or a habitability stamp. Do not add hotel-grade work they do not use, do not mark done without their file, and do not paste lockbox codes onto the punch. They award vendors and they pay.

Starter work map. Replace tools and checks when they **teach**.
